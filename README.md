# LU Decomposition 

## AIM:
To write a program to find the LU Decomposition of a matrix.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner

## Algorithm

i.L AND U MATRIX

1.Input the Matrix:

2.Take a square or rectangular matrix as input (the user provides it). The matrix should be in the form of a 2D array. Convert the input to a NumPy array using np.array(eval(input())). LU Decomposition:

3.Use the lu() function from scipy.linalg to perform LU decomposition of the input matrix. The lu() function decomposes the matrix into three components: piv: The permutation matrix, which represents row swaps (pivoting). l_matrix: The lower triangular matrix (with diagonal elements as 1). u_matrix: The upper triangular matrix. Output the Results:

4.Print the lower triangular matrix (l_matrix). 5.Print the upper triangular matrix (u_matrix).

ii.LU DECOMPOSITION

1.Input the Matrix and Vector:

2.Take a square matrix (matrix) as input, provided in the form of a 2D array.

3.Take a vector (b) as input, which represents the constants in the linear system 𝐴 𝑥
𝑏 Ax=b.

4.LU Factorization:

5.Use the lu_factor() function from scipy.linalg to perform LU decomposition on the matrix.

6.This function decomposes the matrix into a lower triangular matrix 𝐿

7.L, an upper triangular matrix 𝑈

8.U, and a pivoting vector for row permutations. Solve the Linear System:

9.Use the lu_solve() function to solve the linear system 𝐴 𝑥
𝑏 Ax=b, where 𝐴 A is the input matrix, and 𝑏 b is the constant vector. lu_solve() uses the previously computed LU decomposition to find the solution vector 𝑥 x. Output the Solution:

10.Print the solution vector 𝑥 x
